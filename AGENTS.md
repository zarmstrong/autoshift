# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

AutoSHiFt is a Python CLI with a deliberately flat module layout. `auto.py` is the main entry point and coordinates scheduled redemption. `query.py` retrieves SHiFT-code data and maintains the local database, while `shift.py` handles Gearbox authentication and code redemption. Shared helpers live in `common.py`, and schema updates belong in `migrations.py`. Container behavior is defined by `Dockerfile` and `docker-entrypoint.sh`; publishing automation lives in `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`. Runtime state, including cookies and `keys.db`, is stored under `data/` and must not be committed.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Use Python 3.9 or newer. Create an isolated environment and install dependencies:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run `python auto.py --help` to verify the CLI or `python auto.py --redeem bl3:steam` for a real invocation. Because redemption contacts external services and changes account state, use test credentials and a separate profile when experimenting. Build the container with `docker build -t autoshift:dev .`; check it with `docker run --rm -e SHIFT_ARGS=--help autoshift:dev`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Follow PEP 8 conventions: four-space indentation, `snake_case` for functions and variables, `PascalCase` for classes, and uppercase names for constants. Keep modules focused on their current responsibilities. Development tooling declared in `pyproject.toml` includes Flake8, Pylint, mypy, and autoflake. Before submitting, run:

```sh
flake8 *.py
mypy *.py
```

## Testing Guidelines

There is currently no committed automated test suite or coverage threshold. For behavior changes, add focused tests under `tests/` using names such as `test_query.py` and functions such as `test_loads_local_shift_source`. Avoid live Gearbox requests in tests; mock HTTP calls and use temporary databases. At minimum, exercise `python auto.py --help` and the affected code path locally.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent history generally uses short, imperative subjects and Conventional Commit prefixes such as `ci(docker):`, `build(python):`, and `docs:`. Follow that pattern where practical, keep each commit scoped, and explain user-visible effects in the body. When writing or suggesting a commit message, inspect and describe only staged changes (`git diff --cached`); do not include unstaged or untracked work. Pull requests should include a concise summary, validation commands and results, linked issues, and documentation updates for CLI or environment-variable changes. Include logs for runtime fixes; screenshots are only useful for rendered documentation or workflow UI changes.

## Security & Configuration

Never commit credentials, cookies, databases, or populated `data/` directories. Supply secrets through environment variables such as `SHIFT_USER` and `SHIFT_PASS`, and use `AUTOSHIFT_PROFILE` to isolate development state. Treat custom `SHIFT_SOURCE` content as untrusted input.
